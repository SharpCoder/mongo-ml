# mongo-ml

This library is still a work-in-progress but the general idea is to create a light wrapper around deeplearning-4j
such that you can easily instantiate new models and they will automatically be mongo-backed. My use case is kind
of specific so I need to work on making it more generic. But the general idea is there and for simple
cases it should suffice.
